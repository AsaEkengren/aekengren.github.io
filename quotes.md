> “ On the one hand, rules are by their nature constraining. Speech, rules of etiquette, and grammatical rules, all have the effect of limiting what we can and cannot say. It is not for nothing that we all have the picture of the schoolmarm rapping a child across the knuckles for some grammatical error as one of our primodrial images of oppression.

<cite>David Graeber</cite> in "The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy" (2015)

> “Those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand.”
<cite>Kurt Vonnegut</cite>

> “But alas! Science cannot now rescue us, for even the scientist is lost in the terrible midnight of our age. Indeed, science gave us the very instruments that threaten to bring universal suicide.”

> “I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed.”
<cite>Neil Postman</cite> in "Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business" (1985)
